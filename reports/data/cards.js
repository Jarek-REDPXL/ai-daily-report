   RedPxl News — CARDS (durable knowledge atoms)
   A card is a PRACTICAL, AI-POWERED, RUN-IT-TODAY play for a craft —
   advanced but non-technical, step-by-step with exact tools/prompts/clicks
   and a clear payoff. Voice = a sharp operator sharing a trick, never
   news/specs/encyclopedia. EVERY card carries >=1 REAL working link.
   See docs/NORTH-STAR.md (THE STANDARD) before adding or editing cards.

   Card shape:
     id          stable slug, e.g. "card-graphic-font-pairing"
     domains     array of >=1 valid slug from scripts/domains.js (gate-checked)
     title       the play, as an action you can take today
     summary     1-2 sentences: what it is / the fast way
     why         the payoff + POV (why run it)
     action      REQUIRED one-line "do this now" — the single concrete next step
                 (the gate fails any card without it)
     how         array of steps — exact tools/prompts/clicks
     thread_id   OPTIONAL slug — the storyline this card advances (groups cards
                 that tell one evolving story, e.g. "thread-platform-ai-defaults")
     confidence  "confirmed" | "emerging" | "speculative" (play MATURITY)
     corroboration_count  OPTIONAL int — how many INDEPENDENT sources back a
                 claim (separate from confidence). Set on claim/news cards; the
                 gate enforces it can't exceed the distinct source domains, so the
                 "Confirmed (3+) / Reported (2) / Single-source (1)" label can't
                 lie. Omit on tool/technique cards (one official link is fine).
     status      "active" | "superseded"
     supersedes  array of card ids this replaces (or [])
     related     array of related card ids (or [])
     sources     array of { label?, url } — REAL links (url required). NOT markdown
                 or HTML strings. The card view renders them as clickable anchors.
     tags        array of extra tags (e.g. tool/platform tags) (or [])
     created     "YYYY-MM-DD"
     updated     "YYYY-MM-DD"
